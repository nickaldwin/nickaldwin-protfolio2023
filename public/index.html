        <h1>Hi, Nick</h1>
        <h3>Software Engineer based in Phillipins</h3>
        <p>
            Curious and always eager to learn about new and better ways to solve a problem.
            Code, Diagrams and lots of sparkling water are my tools of choice.
            I'm excited about development solutions that feel intuitive and provide better mental models for our abstractions.
            Currently really into React I'm also learning Python.
            When I'm not debugging an error message or crafting the next component, I'm either sat with a good book & a cup of tea or finding some beautiful spots in the wilderness.
